Just walked outta The Amateur and wow, my brain's doing that thing where it tries to process a billion things at once. First off, who decided that was the ending we all needed? Is confusion the new black? Halfway through the popcorn, I was not sure if I was intrigued or just mildly annoyed, like when your cat insists on sitting on your keyboard right when you're trying to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   script for clarity.

So there’s this dude, right? And he's not your typical action hero – more like a frustrated genius who’s kind of had it with everyone’s BS. Is it just me or did the plot feel like a jigsaw puzzle where someone thought it'd be hilarious to swap a couple pieces with another set? One minute you're on edge, next minute you're wondering if you should've gone for a second soda refill.

The cinematography's a wobbly rollercoaster ride through my Sunday morning hangover. Camera shakes like it's trying to break 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 from a toddler's sticky hands. But, somehow it works. Sorta. I guess they wanted us to feel as unstable as the protagonist. You gotta love a good metaphor, right? Or maybe I just like overthinking things. Anyway, it matched the brain fog I've been in all week. So, kudos?

>If you're looking for a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 that's gonna hold your hand and guide you through...you're barking up the wrong cinematic tree here, my friend. This   expects you to do some mental gymnastics – stick the landing, or crash and burn, it's all part of the viewing experience. I can almost hear my high school gym teacher mocking my attempts.

Okay, this was kinda unexpected but I can't stop thinking about how that café scene made me want a grilled cheese so badly. Good job product placement, or maybe just hunger fidgeting with my 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 critique skills. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack; it felt like my eclectic Spotify playlists went rogue during a thunderstorm. Like, could someone please lower the dramatic tension a tad so I can catch my breath?

```javascript
function whatWasThatEnding( ) {
  if ( .title === The Amateur) {
    return  .confusionLevel >= 9000 ? mind.blown() : tryagain();;
  }
}
```

All in all, kinda a headscratcher. You might wanna 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, or just Google the plot to verify it wasn’t just an elaborate prank. Still deciding if I’m gonna be recommending this to friends or swearing them to secrecy about this Friday night detour. Feel 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦 to jump into this chaos of a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 yourself, if you dare. Just bring snacks, lots of them.
